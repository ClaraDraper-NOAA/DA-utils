This program is designed to convert individual variables between resolutions, for DA applications (specificially re-gridding for use in re-centering, and regridding increments).

* Uses bi-linear interpolation, with masking of the input and output. 
* Current masking options are all soil (land, no glaciers) and snow-free soil (input increment only)
* Does not guarantee all output grid cells with have mapped values, by design. CANNOT BY USED FOR RESTARTS (could be changed though).
* Output grid cells that do not have a value after the interpolation step are filled with the nearest neighbouring output grid cell. If there are no mapped neighbours within two layers of surrounding neighbours, the output grid cell will remain unmapped. In this way, islands do not get filled with distant values. 
* Reads in / writes out fv3 files and Gaussian grid (gsi output increment) files.
* Handling Gaussian files requires a scrip file with the grid details. This can be generated using the ufs_utils weigh_gen program.
* has separate namelist for input and output. Required options depend on the grid type and whether it's in/out. Look in readin_setup routine to check what is needed. 
* example nml provided for input Gaussian increment -> fv3 grid.

FEATURES TO ADD:
* Can only process 2D variables (no vertical dimension; TO-DO fix this) 
* Add time dimension to put all gsi increments in a single file (for reading in by IAU) 
* Re-think parallelization so can do multiple ensemble members at once
* Add code to check required options are available for requested set-up grid
